I developed this App to improve the workflow of my Team for our Worship Services.

We only have single device installed with ProPresenter, a Presentation App developed by Renewed Vision.
Therefore when we have several services needed to be prepared, we are essentially waiting on a queue to use the ProPresenter.

Since we also used a text based method in our workflow to import the Slide data, it will be easier if we could forsee the results of said texts before we import it in ProPresenter. This way we could reduce time needed to be on the Device installed with ProPresenter.

This is currently in development. Will update this on weekly basis.
