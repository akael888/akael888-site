This project is based on a similar tool I've build using Coda.io
That said tool was used as a productivity tool during my employment in Tripledot Studios.

However there were slight friction when using it, whereas the user needs to sign up to the host site (Coda.io)

Therefore I built this Tool, using:

- **React Js (create-react-app)**
- **Tailwindcss**
- **Node and Express Js**
- **MongoDB**

### Features

The user are able to:

- **Duplicate X amount of sentences**
- **Define several variables within the sentence before duplicating**
- **Adjust each variable's behaviour and rules when duplicated**

### Development

The Front End Development started on Early **July 2025** and finished around the end of **September 2025**.

Then I continued the Back End Development on Early **October 2025** and finished it around the end of **December 2025**.

### Conclusion

Here's what I gained and learned from this Project:

- The fundamentals of **React** and how to implement them
- Introduction to **Tailwindcss, Node JS & Express JS**
- How to setup Endpoints and test it using **Bruno / Postman**
- How to setup **Database/MongoDB** and connect it to the App
