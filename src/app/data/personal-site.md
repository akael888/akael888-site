I started this Project to Introduce myself to  Next JS, since I was already in the Polishing Stage of my other project : **[Sentence Repeater](https://sentence-repeater.vercel.app)**

I designed this project based on several references listed here
- **[Mcloughlan.com](https://mcloughlan.com)** (Blogpost Style)
- **[George Christeas's Personal Website](https://chr-ge.com)** (Visual References)

### Conclusion
Here's what I gained and learned from this Project:
- The fundamentals of Next JS and how to implement them
- Parsing Markdown using Remark, Grey-Matter and Remark HTML Plugin
- Solidify my knowledge with Tailwind CSS
