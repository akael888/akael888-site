I started this Project to Introduce myself to  Next JS, since I was already in the Polishing Stage for my other project : **[Sentence Repeater](https://sentence-repeater.vercel.app)**
<!--

I used Markdown to store the blog data and convert it to HTML using Grey-Matter and Remark

The reason for this is to improve efficiency when handling new Blogpost. I could easily write down a Markdown anywhere and anytime, and the site will handle all of the conversion.

I designed this project based on several references listed here
- **[Mcloughlan.com](https://mcloughlan.com)** (Blogpost Style)
- **[George Christeas's Personal Website](https://chr-ge.com)** (Visual References)

### Conclusion
Here's what I gained and learned from this Project:
- The fundamentals of **Next JS** and how to implement them
- Parsing **Markdown** using **Remark**, **Grey-Matter** and **Remark HTML Plugin**
- Solidify my knowledge with **Tailwind CSS**
